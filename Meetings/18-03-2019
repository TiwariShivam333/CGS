Today's meeting invlove discussion over three basic functionalities of our web app

We basically thought of developing the product area first since it's the lengthiest part 
of our project.
In order to achieve that we have already-


1.Build the product view- which cosnsists of linking the page with home page, then including 
features in it like-Description,quantity, Specifications, Reviews, and most importantly the
view of the product involving showing it from various perspectives, with also showing the 
related products to at the bottom.


2.The login and signup the pages are ready with the view with single sign in faciltiy with 
google and facebook.


3.Added the Add to Cart page with products list and total amount.


This are not fully functional without the database so once the databse is made it'll get fully 
functional.
