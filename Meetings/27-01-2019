---In today's meeting we planned about how to proceed to design our website according to use-cases described below--

This article below describes basically use-cases associated with our product "Online student Essentials"

A use-case is defining interactions between actors and system. where "An actor might be a person, a company or organization, 
a computer program,or a computer systemâ€”hardware, software, or both."

1.For our website, interactions are mainly between five entities as follows--

1.1 Visitor
   Those who haven't registered the website and are there to traverse the products.
   
1.2 User
   Those who are regular users with proper authentication and authorization.
  
1.3 Admin
   Who can control or has access to the whole website.
  
1.4 Payment system
    All credentials required for a successful payment(online or offline).
   
1.5 Tracking and Delivery system
    Post-order placement system.
    
1.6 Location system
    Required for tracking system and to only show the products to users which are deliverable in the area.
    
   
    We also discussed about problems faced in django tutorials specially during sample view design and its 
    HTTP response inside an app module .
    We did a discussion about dividing our task of project developement into smaller sub-problems that we will 
    discuss in our future meetings.
