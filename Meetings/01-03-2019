What we discussed today?
  We are in the last phase of preprocessing of our software.
  We have basically two diagrams, analysis diagram and design diagram, Analysis diagram deals more closely 
  to the Elicitation phase of our unified model where we analyse our requirements building use case diagrams,
  activity diagrams, class diagrams with just the attributes, then the design diagram falls basically into
  elaboration phase where we advance our planning and do the modelling i.e. create a solution model for our
  problem, where the diagrams of analysis are refined like class diagram is advanced to contain attributes 
  with their type and operations are included. So for we have made almost all the analysis and design diagrams.
  We discussed today to make the last design diagram i.e. the refined collaboration diagram which contain the 
  collaboration details of classes after dividing it into modules.
  We have to make architecture design by monday.
  
What we have to do next?  
  From the next meetings onward we'll move our discussion towards designing the User interface and will be 
  completing a basic UI by monday.
