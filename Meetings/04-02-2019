In continuation of the Previous discussion on Data Object and Class model,
Todays discussion consists of following issues:

1) Class Diagram which contains classes as specific box(see CGS/Class Diagram Example-CGS.pdf) along with the class name, their 
   attributes,and functions associated with the class. We will be using the Exactly same classes for our coding purposes and for 
   drawing Entity-Relationship Diagrams while making Databases for our complete system.
   
2) Collaboration diagrams which is also called as communication Diagrams are used to show how objects interact to perform the 
   behavior of a particular use case, or a part of a use case. Along with Usecase and Activity diagrams, collaborations are used by 
   designers to define and clarify the roles of the objects that perform a particular flow of events of a use case.
   
3) collaboration Diagram can be found at CGS/Collaboration diagram.png

4) A little bit modification in Usecase Diagram has also been considered through this Discussion.

5) coming Discussion may hold issues on Flow Oriented Modeling like DFD etc.
