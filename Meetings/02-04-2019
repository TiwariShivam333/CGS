We discussed following points today in group meeting-

1.Need of Continuous Build integration

It is useful when many developers work on a single software and they are not able to finish their respective jobs simultaneously.
in that scenario Continuous build integration allowes developers finished their jobs to Continue testing without waiting for others.

Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several 
times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early. 

2.Continuous Build integration implementation problems

3.Typesof tests required for our software among unit test,integration test,validation test,system test

4.Creation of model to write unit tests for models as well as creating continuous build integration
