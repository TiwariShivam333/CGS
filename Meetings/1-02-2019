What we did?
  After discussion on activity diagram yesterday and updating it, we discussed about swimlane diagram for our
  daily essentials application which will probably be updated by next meeting.
    In discussion of swimlane diagram we discussed about it and it's uses i.e. A swimlane diagram is also a type of 
    flowchart that describes who does what in a process.Using the metaphor of lanes in a pool, a swimlane diagram 
    provides clarity and accountability. It shows connections, communication and handoffs between these lanes, and 
    it can serve to highlight waste, redundancy and inefficiency in a process.
 We started building a rough view of application in Django.
 
What we thought we do next?
  Finish the swimlane diagram.
  A rough website view.
  Started building databases.
