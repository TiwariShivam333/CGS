Today's meeting mainly consist of discussion over the databases-

1.Manual entry in the database as of now so for a simple working
model of login atleast.

2.What databases will be required for creation of product module 
as it's the biggest module of the project.

3.which module we have to moveon next.


other than this we discussed over build-

Since we are doing our project in python(django) we'll use pybuilder-

  It targets the building and management of software with a strong focus on Python.
  
  Automatic execution of unit and integration tests on every build.
  
  Automatic analysis of the code coverage.
  
  Automatic execution and result interpretation of analysis tools, such as flake8.
  
  Automatic generation of distutils script setup.py.
