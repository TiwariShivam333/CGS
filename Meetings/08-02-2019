Today's meeting involve discussion over the user interface so to start the development.
    Unfortunately DFD didn't get completed by today but certainly will get completely by tommorow's evening as it's in the 
    last phase of it's creation.
    
    Well in today's meeting we discussed the categories in terms of modules and their places in the user interface.
    As we are building daily student essentials, the first level of categories will contain the different organizations/places
    whose products we'll make available  on our application which as of now are New, Old stationary products, household and 
    others needs, then under the second level of categories it'll contain the categories of products like in new stationary 
    products we'll have daily school things like Compass box, pens, pencils, chalk/duster, crafts materials, glue, notebooks 
    text books etc.
    In the old stationary category it'll mainly contain old books, and stationary product which are of no use of some student 
    and are still usable like blank papers.
    In the household category washroom products, study tables, kettle, bottles, speakers, umbrellas, basic utensils, bags etc. 
    can be included.
    And in other needs will include new/old cycles and other products on user's recommendation.
    
    We'll complete the data flow diagram, and start implementing the user interface.
    
    In next meeting we'll discuss django problems and further on UI
    In other immediate meetings we'll discuss creating and connecting databases of the application.
