What we did?
  Discuss the various actors and functionality of each of them.
    There are three type of users as long as we have thought-
    Visitor-A customer who can view items and can send a purchase request, but can't do without getting registered 
    which will be a quick process.
    User- A registered customer who can view item, add it to cart, can checkout by chosing any of the online
    or offline payments, and can have track over his/her order.
    Admin-The controller who can have access to everything, can add items, remove items, view items, update items 
    details and numbers, can add payment modes, registration modes, can update delivery feasible locations, can receive
    payments, track items, track delivery etc.
