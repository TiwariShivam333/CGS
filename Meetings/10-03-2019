  especially before putting it into use or practice.
  
Unit test cases and build in Django
  Unit testing is level of testing where smallest part of individual unit / component (called unit)
  is tested to determine if they are fit for use. 
  The unit test cases writing and execution is done by the developer(not the tester) to make sure that 
  individual units are working as expected.
  
  Build is creating an executable for unit testing.
