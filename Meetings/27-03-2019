Today's meeting was mainly about unit test cases-

Unit Testing is the first level of software testing where the smallest testable parts of a 
software are tested. This is used to validate that each unit of the software performs as
designed.

White Box Testing method is used for Unit testing.

There are four main concepts of unittests

1.A test fixture represents the preparation needed to perform one or more tests, and any associate 
cleanup actions. This may involve, for example, creating temporary or proxy databases, directories, 
or starting a server process.

2.A test case is the smallest unit of testing. It checks for a specific response to a particular set 
of inputs. unittest provides a base class, TestCase, which may be used to create new test cases.

3.A test suite is a collection of test cases, test suites, or both. It is used to aggregate tests 
that should be executed together.

4.A test runner is a component which orchestrates the execution of tests and provides the outcome to 
the user. The runner may use a graphical interface, a textual interface, or return a special value to 
indicate the results of executing the tests.


And how to implement them over the build created previously.
