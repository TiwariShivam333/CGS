Basic overviews of today's group meeting are as follows---

1.we discussed about making swimlane diagram and have completed a rough sketch of it.

Definition of swimlane diagram---
"A swimlane diagram is a type of flowchart that delineates who does what in a process.
Using the metaphor of lanes in a pool, a swimlane diagram provides clarity and accountability by placing 
process steps within the horizontal or vertical “swimlanes” of a particular employee, work group or department."
