After writing unit test cases for two modules we decided to write inegration test case over 
them.

Integration testing exercises two or more parts of an application at once, including the 
interactions between the parts, to determine if they function as intended. This type of
testing identifies defects in the interfaces between disparate parts of a codebase as they
invoke each other and pass data between themselves.

Points
1. Use of selenium for integration testing.

2. How to use it.

3. How to integrate the unit test cases of two modules.
