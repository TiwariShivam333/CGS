Points discussed:-
1) Fitting our Online students Essentials Product system on Scenerio based Modeling.
2) This Model consists of Developing a use case(More or less done), giving a shape to the developed use case through use case Diagram(done),Activity diagram(discussed today),Swimlane Diagram(next Meeting).
3) Activity diagram is supplementary to the Use case diagram which consists of flow of interaction within different scenerio among actor and action being taken according to the decisions.
4) As a result of discussion on Activity_diagram, we come up with a rough diagram realting the intractions of action along with decision.
5) The activity diagram is also uploaded here in the name of activity_diagram.png

NOTE: 1.The black circle in the diagram shows the initiating action.
      2.The black circle incircled within bigger circle shows the final activity.
      3.Alphabet enclosed within circles showing the connection with that alphabet written at somewhere else in the diagram.
