Today's meeting mostly elapsed on the discussion related to Interface:
Following principles are disscussed on the basis of our Online Student Essential requirement.

User familiarity
The interface should use terms and concepts which are drawn from the experience of the people who will make most use of the system.

Consistency
The interface should be consistent in that, wherever possible, comparable operations should be activated in the same way.

Minimal surprise
Users should never be surprised by the behaviour of a system.

Recoverability
The interface should include mechanisms to allow users to recover from errors.

User guidance
The interface should provide meaningful feedback when errors occur and provide context-sensitive user help facilities.

User diversity
The interface should provide appropriate interaction facilities for different types of system user.
