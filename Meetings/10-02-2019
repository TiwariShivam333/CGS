Today's meeting mostly covers the database design disscussion.
After having collected requirement gatherings and user stories, now this is the time when we are trying to fabricate the notions into the tabular form
and establish a proper relationship among different entities.
In this procession the first step was to derive the entities from the gathered material and next was to figure out their attribute which also 
keeps a track of the primary and foreign key assigned to different attributes of a particular entity.
Then we look into the cardinality of the entities while framing relationships.
We reached at a conclusion that some relationship also need to be have some attribute in order clearify that relations.

We have used erdplus as platform for drawing this diagram.
