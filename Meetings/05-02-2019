In our recent discussions we discuss about more about use-cases(adding some more actors),
  build the class diagram feasible to our application with all attributes and operations,
  collaboration diagram which resembles a flowchart that portrays the roles, functionality 
  and behavior of individual objects as well as the overall operation of the system in real time.
  
  
In today's part we discussed about data flow diagram which is also a flow chart i.e. a way of 
  representing flow of data of a process or a system (usually an information system).
  The DFD also provides information about the outputs and inputs of each entity and the process itself.
  A data flow diagram has no control flow, there are no decision rules and no loops. 
  Specific operations based on the data can be represented by a flowchart.
  We created a rough data flow diagram which will be uploaded by few next meetings.
  
In future discussions we plan to discuss E-R diagram, and Django concerns.
