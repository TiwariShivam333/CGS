Today we focused on following points in our group meeting---

1.we discussed about state diagram for our software.Definition for state diagram is given below as follow-

A state diagram is used to represent the condition of the system or part of the system
at finite instances of time. Itâ€™s a behavioral diagram and it represents the behavior using
finite state transitions. State diagrams are also referred to as State machines and State-chart
Diagrams. These terms are often used interchangeably. So simply, a state diagram is used to model
the dynamic behavior of a class in response to time and changing external stimuli.

main advantage we want to extract from it is seamless design of basic views.

2.we discussed about designing basic user interface for our software product without focusing much
  on database part or dataflow.it includes login,signup,and product view etc.
  
  Future works- Design state-diagram and after that we may become able to-
  
                1.designing basic user-interfaces
                
                2.designing Data flow diagram as per need
