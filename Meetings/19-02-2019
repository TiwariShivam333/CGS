Today's discussion involved-

Discussion of the interface and its development over Wordpress and Xampp to be futher integrated with MVC 
framework Django.
Design and architecture diagram-The software must be placed into context.
The design should define the external entities (other systems, devices, people) that the software interacts with 
and the nature of the interaction.
A set of architectural archetypes should be identified.
An archetype is an abstraction (similar to a class) that represents one element of system behavior.
The designer specifies the structure of the system by defining and refining software components that implement each archetype.

Next meetings will involve detailed discussion of Collaboration diagram with modules and User interface.
