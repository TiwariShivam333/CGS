As discussed in previous meeting about the UI Interface and merging it with Django Framework,

Today's was extension of the previous one first we are thinking of designing the interface and test it using 
Xammp server only using it's database, later we'll merge it in Django we also try building the login 
and signup page interface(not functional yet) with availability of quick login and signup(google/facebook
and other social ways). 

Next meetings will involve making the interfaces functional and discussion over ajax to make our forms 
interactive.
